# Multi task learning on a social graph using Graph Convolutional Networks

### Description
Multitask Learning refers to learning a task from different tasks by having multiple views of the same graph data. It is a better approach than the usual machine learning techniques is that it focuses on reducing the overall joint loss function. <br />
This roject involves building the best graph convolution network learning model for a multi-view social graph. It also involves developing a multitask learning model that results in optimizing the joint loss function of the learning task, overruling other ML models such as single learning and ensemble learning while dealing with non-Euclidean data of a multi-view social graph.
